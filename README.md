  <h2> Starting Up </h2>
</head>

<body>
  <p>Getting ready is easy! Just tell Alexa to wake up Smart Minnie. Here are some phrases to do just that.</p>
  <p align = "center"> "Alexa, <i>start</i> Smart Minnie"</p>
  <p align = "center"> "Alexa, <i>open</i> Smart Minnie"</p>
  <p align = "center"> "Alexa, <i>launch</i> Smart Minnie"</p>
  </big>

  <h2> Recording </h2>
</head>

<body> 
  <p> Once Minnie is ready, you'll receive a welcome message letting you know how to start recording those 
   important discussions. This can be done with a few simple words.</p>

  <p align = "center"> <i>"Minnie begin"</i> </p>
  <p align = "center"> <i>"Minnie start"</i> </p>
  <p align = "center"> <i>"Minute this"</i> </p>
  <p align = "center"> <i>"Record this"</i> </p>
  <br />
  <p>Or if Alexa isn't listening and you want to jump straight in to the action</p>
  <p align = "center"> "Minnie begin" </p>
  <p align = "center"> "Minnie start" </p>
  <p align = "center"> "Minute this" </p>
  <p align = "center"> "Record this" </p>
