<body>
  <p> Welcome to the Smart Minnie user guide for Amazon Alexa! 
  Here we give you some simple tips & tricks to help get you started
  with Minnie on your Alexa-enabled device. </p>
  
  <p> Smart Minnie is an Alexa supported application to help you record
  important points during your meetings! Let's take a look at how Minnie works. </p>

  <h2> Starting Up </h2>
</head>

<body>
  <p>Getting ready is easy! Just tell Alexa to wake up Smart Minnie. Here are some phrases to do just that.</p>
  <blockquote><p align = "center"> <i>"Alexa, start Smart Minnie"</i></p>
  <p align = "center"> <i>"Alexa, open</i> Smart Minnie"</i></p>
  <p align = "center"> <i>"Alexa, launch</i> Smart Minnie"</i></p></blockquote>

  <h2> Recording </h2>
</head>

<body> 
  <p> Once Minnie is ready, you'll receive a welcome message letting you know how to start recording those 
   important discussions. This can be done with a few simple words.</p>
  <p align = "center"> <i>"Minnie begin"</i> </p>
  <p align = "center"> <i>"Minnie start"</i> </p>
  <p align = "center"> <i>"Minute this"</i> </p>
  <p align = "center"> <i>"Record this"</i> </p>
  <br />
  <p>And Minnie stops recording just as easily.</p>
  <p align = "center"> <i>"Minnie, pause</i>" </p>
  <p align = "center"> <i>"Minnie, stop recording</i>" </p>
  <p align = "center"> <i>"Okay. Let's move on"</i></p>
  <br />
  <p>Or if Alexa isn't listening and you want to jump straight in to the action:</p>
  <p align = "center"> <i>"Alexa, tell Smart Minnie to record this</i>" </p>
  <p align = "center"> <i>"Alexa, open Smart Minnie and start recording</i>" </p>
  <p align = "center"> <i>"Alexa, tell Smart Minnie begin recording"</i> </p>
