   <h1> Minnie User Guide </h1>
 </head>
 
 <body>
   <p> Welcome to the Minnie Notes user guide for Amazon Alexa! 
   Here we give you some simple tips, tricks and examples to help get you started
   with Minnie on your Alexa-enabled device. </p>
   
   <p> Minnie Notes is an Alexa supported application to help you record
   important points during your meetings! Let's take a look at how Minnie works. </p>
 </body>
 
 <head>
   <h2> Starting Up </h2>
 </head>
 
 <body>
   <p>Getting ready is easy! Just tell Alexa to wake up Minnie Notes. Here are some phrases to do just that.</p>
   <blockquote>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Alexa, start Minnie Notes"</i></p>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Alexa, open Minnie Notes"</i></p>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Alexa, launch Minnie Notes"</i></p>
   </blockquote>
 </body>
 
 <head>
   <h2> Attendance </h2>
 </head>
 
 <body> 
   <p> You can optionally add attendees.</p>
   <blockquote>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Add new speaker"</i> </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>And Minnie will note them down for you.</p>
 </body>
 
 <head>
   <h2> Recording Notes </h2>
 </head>
 
 <body> 
   <p> Once Minnie is ready, you'll receive a welcome message letting you know how to start recording those 
    important discussions. This can be done with a few simple words.</p>
   <blockquote>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Minnie begin"</i> </p>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Minnie start"</i> </p>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Minute this"</i> </p>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Record this"</i> </p>
   </blockquote>
   <br />
   <p>And Minnie stops recording just as easily.</p>
   <blockquote>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Minnie, pause</i>" </p>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Minnie, stop recording</i>" </p>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Okay. Let's move on"</i></p>
   </blockquote>
   <br />
   <p>Or if Alexa isn't listening and you want to jump straight in to the action:</p>
   <blockquote>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Alexa, tell Minnie Notes to record this</i>" </p>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Alexa, open Minnie Notes and start recording</i>" </p>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Alexa, tell Minnie Notes begin recording"</i> </p>
   </blockquote>
 </body>
 
 <head>
   <h2> Cancel that! </h2>
 </head>
 
 <body>
   <p> Said something you didn't mean to? There are commands for that too! </p>
   <blockquote>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Cancel, Minnie"</i></p>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Cancel that"</i><p>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Hold on, Minnie"</i><p>
   </blockquote>
 </body>
 
 <h2> Ask for Help </h2>
 <p> Stuck? Minnie can help you find your bearings. Just ask... </p>
 <blockquote>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Minnie help"</i></p>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Tell me about Minnie"</i><p>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"List commands"</i><p>
   </blockquote>
   
 <h2> When you're done... </h2>
 <body>
   <p> When the meeting is over (and Alexa hasn't drifted off to sleep) you can quickly close everything up and save your recordings for later. Here are just some ways of telling Minnie you're all done. </p>
   <blockquote>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"Stop Minnie"</i></p>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"End meeting"</i><p>
     <p align = "center"> <i>"That's it for today"</i><p>
   </blockquote>
